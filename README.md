# Pima-indians-Diabetes-Database
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. I have predicted on the basis of datasets that a person has diabetes or not. Before prediction, some data cleaning I did.
